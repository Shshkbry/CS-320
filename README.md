### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code is functional and secure by making sure that the code that I write aligns with the software requirements and that each requirement has a corresponding unit test. 
### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I take notes when reading the requirements and write preliminary pseudocode from the very beginning. I use the needs as a checklist to make sure I don't miss anything. 
### How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by doing my best to ensure that the resulting product meets the customer's functional and non-functional requirements using techniques that meet current best practices.
